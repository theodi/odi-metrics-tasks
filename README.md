Architecture
------------

This repository consists of a whole bunch of glue scripts which connect various other systems. They should all have the following features:

* Implemented as [resque jobs](https://github.com/defunkt/resque#section_Jobs).
* Minimal; each job should be as small as possible, spawing other jobs rather than executing big bits of code.
* Idempotent; they should be able to run many times with the same arguments and not cause problems.
* Testable; minimal jobs are very easy to test. This is generally done with cucumber features.

We use [VCR](https://github.com/vcr/vcr) to mock away any HTTP requests during tests.
